Welcome to qsh readme file! Here is some information about it.

At first, qsh consists of several modules:

1. main.c - just one cycle, that processes the keys, prints the greet,
	reads and runs the commands until get_clst() returns NULL what means EOF

2. parser.c - at all, it gets the control at function get_clst which
	reads some stuff and returns a command list with some misc data

3. cmdlib.c - the main function is exec_clst2, which gets a command list
	and runs it with their species

4. interface.c - provides interaction with the user like greeting,
	some confirmations, questions and error messages

5. strlib.c - functions for operations with strings

6. keylib.c - processes command line arguments like --help and others
