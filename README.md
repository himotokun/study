My old study projects (just4lulz)

At the moment there are 3 projects:

* Shell aka qsh — basic command shell like bash or zsh (but much more simple) [language: C]

* Serv aka jew — a simple online multiplayer text game [language: C]

* Robots — programmable robots for the 'jew' game [language: C++]
